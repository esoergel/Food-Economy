Food Economy Engagement Tool
============

A tool to keep track of food purchasing.

This project began during the Local Economies Hackathon at the MIT Sustainability Summit on April 28th, 2013.  Contact me if you're looking to further development of this tool.

The screenshots folder contains a couple images of what the prototype looks like.  "add_purchase.png" shows the basic data entry screen, and "purchase_list.png" shows a list of the purchases that have been entered.  The admin interface also has options to add businesses, categories, and other stuff.
